# ABM-training
Income Distribution &amp; some other stuff using ABM
In Piketty's book Capital in 21th Centry,the author discribed that when interest rate(or investment profit)is larger than the groth rate of income ,the wealth will centralized and poor getting poorer.The only way out is implement inheritance tax.
What I'm interested in is ;
First:How initial income distribution pattern affect the income distribution after several iterates
Second:How tax affect the income distribution.Will the progressive tax have a positive effect? Or will the inheritance tax is the only way out(Piketty's view)
This model may be too hard for a rookie like me,but have a try and have fun.Making progrss is better then stay.Now is time to get some reference.
